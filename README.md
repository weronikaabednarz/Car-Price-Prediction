# Car Price Prediction

The data for the project ‘Used car price prediction.’ collect information on vehicles available on the Polish market.
They contain various characteristics and details that can significantly affect their value, such as: name, year, selling price, number of kilometres driven, fuel, type of seller, gearbox, owner.
Used car price analysis can be very helpful in various contexts, for example in determining the market value of vehicles, predicting prices, making investment decisions and analysing trends in the used car market.
  
Technologies used in the project are Jupyter Notebook & Python with imports:
- pandas - to manipulate and analyse data,
- numpy - a library for scientific calculations, operations on multidimensional arrays and matrices,
- matplotlib - a module for creating graphs,
- seaborn - a data visualisation tool that complements the functionality of Matplotlib,
- os - allows interaction with the operating system, such as access to files and directories,
- warnings - to control the warnings displayed by the Python interpreter,
- plotly.express - to create interactive data visualisations,
- tensorflow as tf - to create and train machine learning models,

    - from PIL import Image - to manipulate images,
    - from google.colab import files - a module to interact with files in Google Colab,
    - from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential - a class that allows you to create sequential neural network models,
    - from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout - layers, used to build neural network models,
    - from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split - a function that splits the data into training and test sets,
    - from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler - normalises features by removing the mean and scaling to a unit variance, to standardise the data,
    - from sklearn.metrics import r2_score - a function that calculates the coefficient of determination R^2, to assess model performance.
